Getting Started
---

Starting with watirmark is easy. We've taken advantage of code generators to give you a head start and create most of the scaffolding that we've found useful in developing tests against our own websites.

```bash
gem install watirmark
watirmark PROJECT_NAME
```

Running the 'watirmark' command will create a small project in the current directory. You can then make sure you're set up properly by running the generated cucumber test in /features that navigates to the home page of your application.
